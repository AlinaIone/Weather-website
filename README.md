## Description

This project is structured in two parts:

- The first part uses [Current weather data](https://openweathermap.org/current) API and displays city, time, temperature, real feel, a short description and wind speed.
- The second part uses [5 day weather forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) API and displays 5 day weather forecast, every 3 hours.

  Weather website project offers the possibility _to change current city_ between the above and _store the choice in localStorage_.

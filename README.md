## Description
The Weather Website is designed to facilitate the accessibility of weather information for some of the notable cities in Romania.

**Key Features**
- **City Selection:** Easily switch between cities of interest using the intuitive dropdown menu.
- **Persistent Settings:** Your chosen city is saved with localStorage, ensuring your preference remains across visits to the site.
- **Enhanced Navigation:** We've implemented a convenient scroll button to speed up your interaction and reduce scrolling time.

This project consists of two parts, both powered by JavaScript:
1. The first part utilizes the [Current weather data](https://openweathermap.org/current) API a to fetch and display real-time weather information, including city, time, temperature, real feel, a short description, and wind speed.
1. The second part makes use of the [5 day weather forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) API to present a detailed 5-day weather forecast, updated every 3 hours, all driven by JavaScript.
